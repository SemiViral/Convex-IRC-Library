# Convex, an IRC library

Convex is an IRC library that achieves the feats none other seem to do. It is idiomatic, easy to understand, and powerful.

Hopefully that's actually true!

# Implementing the IPlugin interface

Implementation of the IPlugin interface is fairly simple; use `Core.cs` as a guideline for this.

# Dependencies

This project makes use of [Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://github.com/aspnet/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) for its database and querying.

For the configuation template, [Json.Net](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) is used.

# Ending note

For questions, or if I've missed anything, feel free to e-mail me at semiviral@gmail.com.

I will be doing more comprehensive documentation at some point. It may be a while.
