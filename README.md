# Convex, an IRC library

 Convex is an IRC library that (tries) to achieve idiomatic simplicty.

 This library targets the .NET Standard 1.6

# Implementing the IPlugin interface

 Implementation of the IPlugin interface is fairly simple; use `Core.cs` as a guideline for this.

# Dependencies

# Ending note

 For questions, or if I've missed anything, feel free to e-mail me at semiviral@gmail.com.

 I will be doing more comprehensive documentation at some point. It may be a while, as the product currently changed regularly.
